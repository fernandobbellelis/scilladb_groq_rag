# ScillaDB_Groq_RAG: A High-Performance RAG Chatbot Solution

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to addressing and overcoming the challenges I faced with a specific client who complained about the response time of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot one year ago. At that time, I was at a loss on how to optimize the RAG chatbot for faster response times. However, with advancements in technology and newfound knowledge, I am now equipped to tackle the root cause of those issues.

This project is a culmination of my determination to solve the problem by leveraging modern technologies. It integrates embeddings generated using ModernBert, stored and retrieved efficiently with ScillaDB, and utilizes Groq as the LLM (Language Learning Model) provider.

## Key Components

1. **RAG Chatbot**: A chatbot that combines retrieval-based and generative-based approaches to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
2. **ModernBert for Embeddings**: Utilizes the ModernBert model to generate high-quality embeddings for input text.
3. **ScillaDB for Storage and Retrieval**: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings using ScillaDB, ensuring low-latency access.
4. **Groq as LLM Provider**: Employs Groq for the language learning model, enhancing the chatbot's generative capabilities.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for fast response times, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data and concurrent users efficiently.
- **Accuracy**: Combines retrieval-based and generative-based approaches to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses.
- **Modern Technology Stack**: Integrates state-of-the-art technologies like ModernBert, ScillaDB, and Groq.
